# About
VSlices is a high-level, develop in C#, modular framework  that aims to a faster but clean and pragmatic software developtment Is heavy inspired in the vertical slices architecture and the functional programming. Is also Domain Driven Development friendly.

The documentation of the software is [here in readthedocs](https://vslice-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), there you'll learn the functionalities that the framework brings. It also has and explication of the implementation of the proposed architecture and the good practices

If you find a problem with the documentation, have a improvement or clarification proposal, you can generate a ticket here: [link](https://github.com/HernanFAR/vslice-framework/issues)

## Versioning
We use [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for production-ready releases:
- We increment Major (the X in X.Y.Z) versions when we make a change that breaks backward compatibility. The current major version is 5.
- We increment Minor (the Y in X.Y.Z) versions when we add backward compatible features.
- We increment Patch (the Z in X.Y.Z) versions when we make backward compatible bug fixes or improvements in the documentation.
- We increment Pre-releases (the W in X.Y.Z-pre.W) versions, when we make a pull request to the related release.

Also, the framework's packages will be updated **at the same version, at the same time**, that implies that if VSlices.Core.Abstracts gets updated to the v6, **all the nugets will be updated to the v6**.

## Support policy
Since v6, we will only support the latest 2 versions, except in v6, in which only we'll support v6. 

That means when we release v6, only v6 will be supported and will get security updates or bug fixes, and v5 backwards will no longer get security updates.

## How to contribute
If you want to make contributions to the framework, you must follow the framework convetions. This is detailed [here](how%20to%20contribute.md)
